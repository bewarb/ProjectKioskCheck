# ProjectKioskCheck

### To start working on the program:

After you clone the repo, open a terminal in VS code or just your machine and run

```pip3 install flask```

You may need to restart the editor if it still doesn't seem to recognize the import.

Things to implement:

- Security so not everyone can fill out the form https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-password-protect-a-page-using-only-html-css-and-javascript (possible idea)
- Correct fields for the kiosk check
- The ability to see charts about the data in the spreadsheet
- Uniform style of filling out the fields? (Like a drop list instead of typing each entry)
- Timestamping entries

Known bugs to fix:

- If the page is reloaded and the user hits resumbit on the browser it creates a duplicate entry
